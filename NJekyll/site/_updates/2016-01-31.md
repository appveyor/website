## Slack notification breaking changes

There was a [bug in Slack notification provider](https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues/623) when AppVeyor was always prepending channel name with `#`
and preventing sending notifications to private channels. Now, when that bug is fixed and AppVeyor is not adding `#` to a channel name anymore you
may need to update your Slack notification settings to make sure public channel name starts with `#`. In `appveyor.yml` you need to quote channel name
to pass YAML validation, for example:

    - provider: Slack
      auth_token:
        secure: AAABBB+CCC==
      channel: '#channel'
