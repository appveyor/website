title: Projects tagging, filtering and paging
---

We've just deployed AppVeyor update introducing paging, filtering and tagging on Projects page!

Default page size is 10. You can change page size on profile page: [https://ci.appveyor.com/profile](https://ci.appveyor.com/profile)

Tags can be specified on General tab of project settings (at the very bottom of the page):

Enjoy!
