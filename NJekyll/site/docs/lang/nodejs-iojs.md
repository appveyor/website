# Testing with Node.js and io.js

<!--TOC-->

## Quick start

Put this simple `appveyor.yml` to the root of your repository and it should work for the most Node.js projects out there:

    # Test against this version of Node.js
    environment:
      nodejs_version: "0.12"

    # Install scripts. (runs after repo cloning)
    install:
      # Get the latest stable version of Node.js or io.js
      - ps: Install-Product node $env:nodejs_version
      # install modules
      - npm install

    # Post-install test scripts.
    test_script:
      # Output useful info for debugging.
      - node --version
      - npm --version
      # run tests
      - npm test

    # Don't actually build.
    build: off


## Line endings

By default, Git on build workers is configured with `git config --global core.autocrlf input` which means your repo is cloned "as is" without fixing new lines on Windows. If you have a file with a string `abc\n line2` it will be checked out exactly as `abc\n line2` and if there is `line1 \r\n line2` in the repo you'll get the same on checkout. See this SO answer explaining in details [`core.autocrlf` modes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1249932/git-1-6-4-beta-on-windows-msysgit-unix-or-dos-line-termination/1250133#1250133).

However, if you expect Git to fix line endings on Windows and checkout *all* strings with `\r\n` you could tell Git doing that during `init` phase of your build which occurs *before* cloning command:

    init:
      - git config --global core.autocrlf true

> Anyway, we do not recommend relying on `core.autocrlf` value set on AppVeyor build workers and always explicitly change this setting during the build or [have it configured per-repository](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/).


## Selecting Node.js or io.js version

Build workers have the most recent versions of Node.js and io.js pre-installed - both `x86` and `x64`. If you do nothing your scripts will run under `Node.js 0.12.0 (x86)` (at the time of writing).

To switch to a different version of Node.js or io.js use the following PowerShell command:

    Install-Product node <version> [x86|x64]

`<version>` can be specified as `MAJOR` to install *absolute latest* version of Node.js or io.js, `MAJOR.MINOR` to install *the latest* Node.js or io.js build or `MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD` to install *specific* build. When `MAJOR` part of the `<version>` is `1` then **io.js** is installed.

For example to switch runtime to the **latest version of Node.js** use this command (at the time of writing this is the latest 0.12.x branch):

    Install-Product node 0

To switch Node.js to the latest available 0.11.x branch use:

    Install-Product node 0.11

To select specific x64 version of Node 0.12.0:

    Install-Product node 0.12.0 x64

Any `1.x` version automatically assumes you want io.js, so to switch to the **latest version of io.js** use this command:

    Install-Product node 1

In `appveyor.yml` you should prefix command with `ps` to tell AppVeyor it's PowerShell:

    install:
    - ps: Install-Product node 1

### How that works

Pre-installed Node.js distributives are stored in `C:\avvm\node` folder. When you run `Install-Product node` command it's, basically, moving `nodejs` or `iojs` folder from there to `Program Files`, so the switch is very quick. To check what versions are available on build worker you could do `dir C:\avvm\node`.

The following paths are always added to `PATH` environment variable:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs
    C:\Program Files (x86)\iojs
    C:\Program Files\nodejs
    C:\Program Files\iojs
    C:\Users\appveyor\AppData\Roaming\npm

### Installing *any* version of Node.js or io.js

Sometimes pre-installed versions of Node.js or io.js are little behind (this is especially true for io.js), but what if you need to test under bleeding edge. You could use another PowerShell cmdlet which does full re-install of Node.js or io.js to a selected version.

    Update-NodeJsInstallation <version> [x86|x64]

Here `<version>` is **exact version** of Node.js or io.js.

For example the following command will download and install io.js 1.0.2:

    Update-NodeJsInstallation 1.0.2

There is a helper cmdlet checking remote dist directory of Node.js or io.js to determine absolute latest build available:

    Get-NodeJsLatestBuild <major>.<minor>

It could be used together with previous cmdlet to always install the latest build, for example:

    Update-NodeJsInstallation (Get-NodeJsLatestBuild 1.0)




## Testing under multiple versions of Node.js or io.js

AppVeyor enables easy testing against multiple combinations of platforms, configurations and environments with [build matrix](/docs/build-configuration#build-matrix).

To test under latest version of Node.js and io.js you can specify in `appveyor.yml`:

    environment:
      matrix:
      # node.js
      - nodejs_version: "0.10"
      - nodejs_version: "0.11"
      # io.js
      - nodejs_version: "1.0"

    install:
      - ps: Install-Product node $env:nodejs_version

To allow failing jobs for bleeding-edge Node.js versions:

    matrix:
      allow_failures:
        - nodejs_version: "0.11"

What if you need to test under specific version of Node.js for both x86 and x64 platforms? You could add another "dimension" to the matrix, for example:

    environment:
      matrix:
      - nodejs_version: "0.10"
      - nodejs_version: "1.0"

    platform:
      - x86
      - x64

    install:
      - ps: Install-Product node $env:nodejs_version $env:platform

This configuration will produce a build with 4 jobs for all combinations of node version and platform:

    Node.js 0.10.x   x86
    Node.js 0.10.x   x64
    io.js 1.0.x      x86
    io.js 1.0.x      x64


## Deploying a Node.js website to Azure

You can use Web Deploy to [deploy your Node.js website](/docs/deployment/web-deploy#using-web-deploy-with-a-node-js-website) to Azure.


## Known issues



### Wrong output encoding

When running `npm install` (or any other Node.js program writing to a console) you may notice that Unicode symbols written to build console look wrong:

![node-output-wrong](/site/images/docs/lang/node-output-wrong.png)

This is because you are calling that program from PowerShell:

    - ps: npm install

To fix that run it in "shell" mode:

    - npm install

![node-output-correct](/site/images/docs/lang/node-output-correct.png)

At the moment it seems to be an issue with PowerShell and the way it redirects output from console apps to a custom PowerShell host.



### Garbled or missing output

Sometimes you may notice that output of some Node.js programs (especially those ones actively writing to both StdOut and StdErr) is garbled or missing.

In two words, there was Windows-specific issue in Node.js with non-blocking StdErr ([joyent/node#3584](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3584)) which was fixed in this pull request [joyent/node#7196](https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/7196) and finally landed in **Node.js v0.11.12** ([joyent/node@20176a9](https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/20176a98416353d4596900793f739d5ebf4f0ee1)). There is a [great discussion of this problem](https://github.com/mapnik/node-mapnik/issues/257#issuecomment-44417280).

Solution - run your tests under Node.js 0.11.x.



### Locking errors (EPERM, EEXIST, tgz.lock)

Sometimes you may encounter sporadic "lock" errors that might look like:

    npm ERR! Error: EPERM, open 'C:\Users\appveyor\AppData\Roaming\npm-cache{something}-package-tgz.lock'
    npm ERR! EEXIST, open '{some-path}\npm-cache{something}-package-tgz.lock'

By default, Node.js comes with pre-installed `npm` of version `1.x`. However, most of these "racing condition" issues were fixed in npm 2.0.

Solution - install npm 2.0:

    npm -g install npm@2
    set PATH=%APPDATA%\npm;%PATH%
