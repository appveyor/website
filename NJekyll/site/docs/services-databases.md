# Services and databases

AppVeyor is an ideal platform for integration testing:

- Your build script has admin access to the build machine - you are free to do whatever you like to support your testing process: install new software, run services, even format disk drives :)
- Build machines are transient, which means the state between builds is not preserved and the next build is started on a fresh build machine - basically, you don't need any clean-up logic in your build scripts.

AppVeyor has most popular services and database engines pre-installed on all build machines:

* [SQL Server 2008](#sql-server-2008)
* [SQL Server 2012](#sql-server-2012)
* [SQL Server 2014](#sql-server-2014)
* [MySQL](#mysql)
* [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)
* [MongoDB](#mongodb)
* [Internet Information Services](#internet-information-services)
* [Microsoft Message Queuing](#microsoft-message-queuing)

By default, their corresponding Windows services are stopped to reduce build machine boot time. On the **Environment** tab of project settings or in `appveyor.yml` you can configure which services must be started after the build machine has booted.

### Importing your existing database

You can use the following PowerShell script to attach your own SQL Server database in `.MDF` format:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/FeodorFitsner/6a734f5ee48de949df02.js"></script>

## MySQL

MySQL 5.7 x64 database service is available on AppVeyor build workers.

* Path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7`
* Server name: `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`
* Server port: `3306`
* `root` password: `Password12!`

To start MySQL in `appveyor.yml`:

    services:
      - mysql

This is an example how to supply MySql credentials to work with PowerShell tools:

    $env:MYSQL_PWD="Password12!"
    $cmd = '"C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin\mysql" -e "create database YourDatabase;" --user=root'
    iex "& $cmd"

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL 9.3 and 9.4 x64 database services are available on AppVeyor build workers.

* Path:

	* `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.4`
    * `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.5`
* Server name: `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`
* Server port: `5432`
* `postgres` account password: `Password12!`

To start PostgreSQL 9.4 in `appveyor.yml`:

    services:
      - postgresql    # or postgresql94

To start PostgreSQL 9.3 in `appveyor.yml`:

    services:
      - postgresql93

This is an example how to supply PG credentials to work with command-line tools:

    SET PGUSER=postgres
    SET PGPASSWORD=Password12!
    PATH=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.3\bin\;%PATH%
    createdb YourDatabase

## MongoDB

To start MongoDB in `appveyor.yml`:

    services:
      - mongodb



## Internet Information Services
