## System status

Check this page (powered by [StatusPage.io](https://www.statuspage.io/)) for any ongoing issues happening to AppVeyor:

<a href="https://appveyor.statuspage.io" style="font-size:1.1rem;" target="_blank">https://appveyor.statuspage.io</a>

## Forums and support tickets

AppVeyor support forums is a great source of solutions to various problems provided by AppVeyor team and community.

<a href="http://help.appveyor.com" style="font-size:1.1rem;" target="_blank">http://help.appveyor.com</a>


* Use forums if you want to report the issue, make a suggestion or have a general discussion.
* Forums are hosted by [Tender](https://tenderapp.com/). Tender does not support HTTPS on custom domains, so if you need accessing AppVeyor support forums via **HTTPS** please use this URL: [https://appveyor.tenderapp.com](https://appveyor.tenderapp.com)
* By default all discussions are public and searchable, but you can start a private discussion by choosing `This is a private discussion, don't let the public see it` option. Alternatively, once discussion is already posted as public its visibility can be changed by either you or AppVeyor team using **Make private** toggle button on the right side bar.
* When the private ticket is solved with solution provided and conversation doesn't contain any sensitive data (logs, IPs, passwords, etc.) we encourage you **making it public** so the solution could be easily discovered by AppVeyor users.

## Email

Whether it's sales question or support request you can always contact us by email:

<a href="mailto:team@appveyor.com" style="font-size:1.1rem;">team@appveyor.com</a>


## Technical updates

Whenever AppVeyor service or build workers are updated we add a new entry to this feed:

<a href="/updates" style="font-size:1.1rem;">https://www.appveyor.com/updates</a>

* Subscribe to receive Technical updates email notification on your [profile page](https://ci.appveyor.com/profile).


## GitHub issues

See what's planned for development or what has just been delivered. AppVeyor maintains public GitHub repository to track development progress and you are welcome to submit your feature request or bug there:

<a href="https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues" style="font-size:1.1rem;" target="_blank">https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues</a>

Issue submission guidelines:

* Do not submit duplicate issues. Search first and if similar request/bug found leave your comment there to upvote.
* Be specific - avoid including few requests/bugs into a single issue. Sometimes, before submitting a new issue it makes sense to discuss it on [support forums](http://help.appveyor.com).


## Twitter

<a href="https://twitter.com/appveyor" style="font-size:1.1rem;" target="_blank">@appveyor</a>

* You are welcome to ask a quick question on Twitter, but if 140 symbols is not enough to clearly formulate the problem or we are going to have multiple replies in conversation - please respect other AppVeyor subscribers and switch to either PM or [support forums](http://help.appveyor.com).

## StackOverflow

You can use `appveyor` tag to [submit your question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/appveyor/info).

## Skype

[Contact us](mailto:team@appveyor.com) to arrange a chat via Skype.
