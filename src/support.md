## GitHub issues

See what's planned for development or what has just been delivered. AppVeyor maintains public GitHub repository to track development progress and you are welcome to submit your feature request or bug there:

<https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues>

Issue submission guidelines:

* Do not submit duplicate issues. Search first and if similar request/bug found leave your comment there to upvote.
* Be specific - avoid including few requests/bugs into a single issue. Sometimes, before submitting a new issue it makes sense to discuss it on [support forums](https://help.appveyor.com).

## Twitter

<a href="https://twitter.com/appveyor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@appveyor</a>

* You are welcome to ask a quick question on Twitter, but if 140 symbols is not enough to clearly formulate the problem or we are going to have multiple replies in conversation - please respect other AppVeyor subscribers and switch to either PM or [support forums](https://help.appveyor.com).

## StackOverflow

You can use `appveyor` tag to [submit your question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/appveyor/info).
