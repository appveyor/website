                    <ol>
                        <li>First, our website uses cookies. These cookies are automatically placed on your computer or mobile
                            device that uniquely identify your browser or device. We use cookies to personalize content and
                            ads, to provide social media features and to analyse our traffic. We also share information about
                            your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners who may combine
                            it with other information that you&rsquo;ve provided to them or that they&rsquo;ve collected
                            from your use of their services. By using our website, you are consenting to our use of cookies.</li>
                        <li>Second, we collect personal information that you provide to us through our Site. If you create an
                            account with us, the personal information that you provide is used for the purposes set forth
                            in Section 3.2, below. If, when you create an account, you use the option to sign up with you
                            existing developer account, we may receive additional personal information about you depending
                            on your settings with such developer account. If we receive information additional to your name
                            and email address, you expressly consent to us receiving and processing that information for
                            the purposes set forth in Section 3.2, below. If you also consent to receiving emails from us,
                            either when you create an account or at any other time, we will use the personal information
                            you provide for the purposes set forth in Section 3.3, below.</li>
                        <li>Finally, if a user creates an account, that person is the &quot;Account Owner.&quot; The Account
                            Owner may invite other users (each, an &quot;Invited Users&quot;) to the same account by entering
                            the email address of the Invited User as indicated in our Services. We use such email address
                            solely for the purposes of delivering the invitation. No other personal information is collected
                            about the Invited User unless the invitation is accepted and the Terms and Conditions of this
                            Privacy Policy are consented to. We keep the email address of the Invited User until the earliest
                            of one of the following: (i) the Owner deletes the invitation; (ii) the account for which the
                            invitation is deleted; or (iii) the Invited User sends us a request to delete the invitation
                            (such requests can be made in writing to team@appveyor.com.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>We collect the names and emails addresses of all account Users. If you sign up for a paid account, we will
                    also collect your billing information (name and address). We use encrypted technology to process your
                    payment through our third party payment processor (Stripe), which means we never have access to your
                    credit card details. Occasionally, we may request additional personal information for the specific purpose
                    of providing Services that require that information. If you are the Owner of an account, then you can
                    make a written request to have your account deleted by writing to team@appveyor.com. We will delete your
                    account within 30 days, along with the personal information of any User associated with that account.&nbsp;
                    If you are not the account Owner, you can make a request to the Owner of the account to remove you from
                    the account. You can also write us directly at team@appveyor.com to request removal. When you are removed,
                    all of your personal information associated with that account is also deleted. Note that deleting your
                    account or removing yourself from an account does not remove you from our mailing list, but you can unsubscribe
                    from our mailing list at any time. We use the personal information provided through your account to administer
