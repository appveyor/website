title: AppVeyor premium build environment and new pricing
---

Hello,<br/>
Based on feedback from our customers we've been working on improving AppVeyor performance
and got amazing results!

## New super-fast environment

For the last couple of months we’ve been experimenting with running builds on new "Premium" environment.
It’s based on Hyper-V and hosted on a dedicated hardware with SSD drives and faster CPUs.

We moved most of our existing customers to this new environment and they were very satisfied with the
results. Builds start almost instantly, run 2-3 times faster with greater stability!

We still have Azure environment for open-source projects and "Basic" plan.


## New Pricing

With the introduction of the new environment we decided to review our plans once again to make them
more flexible for companies with different business needs.

There is a new entry-level plan for individual developers and small teams with 1 private project
and 1 concurrent job building on Azure. There is an upgraded "Pro" plan now with **unlimited** number
of projects and **super-fast builds**. For those teams actively using AppVeyor new "Premium" plan now
offers 3 concurrent jobs on fast environment.

Also, we introduce yearly pricing for "Pro" and "Premium" plans giving you **2 months free**!

All existing plans are honored.

If you are a student, educational organization or open-source project looking for more calculation
power or concurrent jobs we provide **50% discount** on all plans.


## AppVeyor on-premise

You may have noticed that we don’t have "Enterprise" plan anymore. This is because "Enterprise" is
reserved for AppVeyor on-premise edition that will be available in January 2015!

If you are interested to be a beta tester just reply to this message and we’ll add you to the
"AppVeyor Enterprise early bird" mailing list.
We'll be publishing more information and roadmap for on-premise in the coming weeks.


## Updated website

AppVeyor has gathered many great open-source projects, such as Mono, Julia, Grunt, Redis, nodegit,
Chocolatey, JSON.net just to mention a few. People contribute their priceless knowledge and experience
on [AppVeyor forums](https://help.appveyor.com/discussions).

To more actively engage the community in shaping AppVeyor we decided to host our entire website with
documentation on GitHub where everyone could contribute by sending a pull request.

See <https://github.com/appveyor/website>.

The website runs on a new [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-like engine (we called it **NJekyll**),
so you can grab it and use for your own website :)
