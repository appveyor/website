                <li>AppVeyor does not warrant that the Services will meet the requirements of the User. AppVeyor is not responsible for problems caused by changes in, or modifications to, the operating characteristics of any computer hardware or operating system for which the Services are procured, nor is AppVeyor responsible for problems which result from the use of the Services in conjunction with software of third parties or with hardware which are incompatible with the operating system for which the Services are being procured.</li>

Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for incidental, consequential or other damages so the limitation or exclusion in Section 14 may not apply to all Users.</li>
                <li>Every exemption from liability, limitation and condition contained in this Agreement for the benefit of AppVeyor and every defence and immunity of any nature applicable to AppVeyor or to which AppVeyor is entitled under this Agreement will also be available and will extend to protect each of AppVeyor, Third-Parties or any of their respective affiliates, licensees, partners or suppliers or the directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or customers of any of them.

                <li>To the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, AppVeyor, on behalf of itself and its directors, officers, employees, contractors, developers, suppliers and any other related service-providers, disclaims any and all liability for:
                    <ol>
                        <li>special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages (including loss of profits); and</li>

                                <li>self-hosted Git, Mercurial, TFVC or Subversion repository;</li>
                                <li>hosted on GitHub, BitBucket, Visual Studio Team Services, Kiln or GitLab; or</li>
                                <li>hosted on other services.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                        <li>In the provision of building and testing Services, AppVeyor downloads (clones) User Code to the Build Environment, which for greater certainty does not leave the boundaries of the Build Environment and is only retained in the Build Environment for the duration of the build using such User Code.</li>

                        <li>When a build is completed, the virtual machine handling such User Code is either deleted or restored to initial state and the User Code is removed from such virtual machine.</li>

                        <li>AppVeyor will not access User Code, build virtual machines, build and environment configurations, logs or artifacts without the User’s permission. By requesting any Services, you are deemed to be granting such permission to AppVeyor for the provision of such Services.</li>

                        <li>AppVeyor uses SSH keys or OAuth tokens whenever possible to clone code repository.</li>
