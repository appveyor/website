                <li>THE WARRANTIES MADE IN SECTION 9 ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESSED, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, AND APPVEYOR DISCLAIMS AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED AT LAW, THE LICENSEE WAIVES ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, DURABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, SERVICES, UPDATES, UPGRADES, SUPPLEMENTS, SUPPORT SERVICES AND ANY OTHER ITEMS OR SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER.</li>

Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for incidental, consequential or other damages so the limitation or exclusion in Section 11 may not apply to all Licensees.</li>
                <li>Every exemption from liability, limitation and condition contained in this End User License Agreement for the benefit of AppVeyor and every defence and immunity of any nature applicable to AppVeyor or to which AppVeyor is entitled under this End User License Agreement will also be available and will extend to protect each of AppVeyor, Third-Parties or any of their respective affiliates, licensees, partners or suppliers or the directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or customers of any of them. For the purpose of all such provisions, AppVeyor is and will be deemed to be acting as agent and trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of all such persons.</li>
                <li>To the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, AppVeyor, on behalf of itself and its directors, officers, employees, contractors, developers, suppliers and any other related service-providers, disclaims any and all liability for special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages (including loss of profits); and punitive and exemplary damages, arising out of this End User License Agreement or with respect to the installation, implementation, customization, use, operation, training, maintenance or support of the Licensed Software, Services, Updates, Upgrades and Supplements, even if AppVeyor or its developers or suppliers have been apprised of the possibility of such damages.</li>
                <li>To the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, the Licensee agrees that any liability on the part of AppVeyor and its suppliers, arising out of this End User License Agreement or with respect to the installation, implementation, customization, use, operation or support of the Licensed Software, Services, Updates, Upgrades and Supplements shall not exceed the depreciated value of the amount paid by the Licensee in fees for the Licensed Software, Update, Upgrade or Supplement which gave rise to such claim. Such depreciation shall be based on straight line depreciation schedule over a period of three (3) years.</li>
                <li>THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION 11 SHALL APPLY TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONDITION, BREACH OF CONTRACT, FUNDAMENTAL BREACH OR ANY OTHER FORM OF BREACH, NEGLIGENCE, OTHER TORT CLAIMS, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY.</li>

The Licensee’s failure to pay all amounts due under this End User License Agreement or any Contract Documentation, including but not limited to the Terms of Service, shall constitute a default of its material obligations. In the event that AppVeyor terminates this End User License Agreement due to a default of a material obligation in the End User License Agreement, AppVeyor will not return any fees that the Licensee remitted in respect of the Licensed Software or Services, irrespective of whether such fees were remitted in connection with any period of License that may extend beyond the date of termination of this End User License Agreement.</li>
                <li>AppVeyor may terminate this End User License Agreement at any time, with or without notice, for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In the event that AppVeyor terminates this End User License Agreement and the Licensee has remitted fees in respect of the Licensed Software or Services that extends beyond the date of termination of this End User License Agreement, AppVeyor will return such fees to the Licensee for the period of License that extends beyond the date of termination of this End User License Agreement.</li>
                <li>The Licensee may terminate this End User License Agreement at any time, for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, by emailing AppVeyor at <a href="mailto:team@appveyor.com">team@appveyor.com</a>. In the event that the Licensee exercises its option to terminate this End User License Agreement, AppVeyor will not return any fees that the Licensee remitted in respect of the Licensed Software or Services, irrespective of whether such fees were remitted in connection with any period of License that may extend beyond the date of termination of this End User License Agreement.
                </li>
                <li>Upon termination of this End User License Agreement, regardless of the cause, the license granted under this End User License Agreement is immediately revoked.

                    <ol>
                        <li>return to AppVeyor or destroy all copies of the Licensed Software in the Licensee’s possession; and</li>
                        <li>if asked by AppVeyor, deliver a certificate of an officer of that party, if the Licensee is a corporation, or an executed letter if the Licensee is an individual, certifying that the same has been completed.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>The Licensee shall continue to be obligated for any payments due as of the date of termination. Termination of the End User License Agreement shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies available to AppVeyor. Termination shall not relieve either party of their confidentiality obligations as set forth in this End User License Agreement.</p>
        </li>

        <li>INDEMNITY
            <ol>
                <li>The Licensee agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless AppVeyor, Third-Parties, their affiliates, licensees, partners and suppliers, and the directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and customers of each of them, from any loss or damages, including without limitation actual legal fees, which they may suffer from the Licensee’s activities on or use of the Licensed Software or Services, including without limitation (i) any breach by the Licensee of this End User License Agreement, (ii) the violation of any law, rule, regulation or rights of others in connection with the Licensee’s use of the Licensed Software or Services, or (iii) any charges or complaints made by other parties against the Licensee.</li>
                <li>AppVeyor shall have the right to control the defense of all claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings based on a claim that the Licensed Software or Services used within the scope of this End User License Agreement infringes any copyright, patent, or trade secret of a third party. In no event shall the Licensee settle any such claim, lawsuit, or proceeding without AppVeyor’s prior written approval, and AppVeyor shall have no liability for any settlement or compromise made without its consent. AppVeyor shall have no liability for any claim under this Section if said infringement claim is based on the use of a superseded or altered version of the Licensed Software or in the event such claim is based upon any modification or enhancement to the Licensed Software made by the Licensee or Authorized Users. In the event a third party infringement claim is sustained in a final judgment from which no further appeal is taken or possible, or if the Licensee’s use of the Licensed Software or Services is enjoined by a court, or if AppVeyor believes the Licensed Software or Services infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, then AppVeyor shall, in its sole election and at its expense either:
                    <ol>
                        <li>procure for the Licensee the right to continue to use the Licensed Software and Services pursuant to this End User License Agreement;</li>
                        <li>replace or modify the Licensed Software and Services to make it non-infringing, provided that such replacement or modification does not materially decrease the functionality of the Licensed Software or Services; or</li>
                        <li>terminate this End User License Agreement, including the Services.</li>
                    </ol>
