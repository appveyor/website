# Build phase

After cloning the repository AppVeyor runs **MSBuild** to build project sources and package artifacts.

The following command is used:

    msbuild <project> /logger:"C:\Program Files\AppVeyor\BuildAgent\Appveyor.MSBuildLogger.dll"

> Custom logger is required to push MSBuild warning and errors in real-time to build console. You may use this logger in your own build scripts.

`<project>` is a Visual Studio project (`*.*proj`) or solution (`*.sln`) file. If project or solution file is not specified on project settings AppVeyor searches for the first occurence of `*.sln` or `*.*proj` file in the build clone directory recursively.

You may configure your own custom build script ("Script" mode) instead of calling MSBuild or disable build phase altogether.


## Automatic packaging of build artifacts

Before running MSBuild AppVeyor analyzes the supplied project or solution file to determine the type and "flavor" of all projects.

### Packaging Web Application projects (WAP)

To package Visual Studio WAP AppVeyor runs the following command:

    msbuild <wap_project> /t:Package /p:PackageLocation=<web-deploy-package.zip>

This command performs compilation and publishing of WAP into a Web Deploy package. The produced package is pushed to artifacts and can be deployed using [Web Deploy](/docs/deployment/web-deploy) or [Agent](/docs/deployment/agent) providers.


### Packaging NuGet libraries

If the project folder contains a `*.nuspec` file AppVeyor will try to package the project as a NuGet library by calling the following command:

    nuget pack <project_file> -OutputDirectory <temp_path>

For example, given the following project structure:

![nuget-pack-project](/assets/images/docs/nuget-pack-project.png)

AppVeyor will call:

    nuget pack SimpleConsole.Tests.csproj -OutputDirectory <temp_path>

> To generate a `.nuspec` file for your project use the `nuget spec` command.



### Packaging Azure Cloud Service projects

If Azure Cloud Service project (`.ccproj`) is found with the solution AppVeyor will create Azure Cloud Service package (`.cspkg`) using the following command:

    msbuild <ccproj_file> /t:Publish /p:PublishDir=<temp_path>

Created Cloud Service package (`<project-name>.cspkg`) and default "Cloud" configuration (`<project-name>.cscfg`) will be published to build artifacts. In addition to that **all** `.cscfg` files found in Cloud Service project folder are pushed to artifacts with names `<project-name>.<config>.cscfg`.

#### Selecting cloud service configuration

By default, MSBuild uses `<project>.Cloud.cscfg` cloud service configuration, but you can specify which configuration to use by adding a `TargetProfile` environment variable, for example:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>TargetProfile</td>
        <td>Staging</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### Caveats

While trying to build an Azure Cloud Service project you may get the following (or similar related) error:

    The imported project "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\vX.X\Windows Azure Tools\2.X\Microsoft.WindowsAzure.targets" was not found.

To fix this error add the following environment variable on the **Environment** tab of project settings:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>VisualStudioVersion</td>
        <td>12.0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

where 12.0 is your version of Visual Studio (VS 2013 - 12.0, VS 2012 - 11.0, VS 2010 - 10.0).
