# Services and databases

AppVeyor is an ideal platform for integration testing:

* Your build script has admin access to the build machine - you are free to do whatever you like to support your testing process: install new software, run services, even format disk drives :)
* Build machines are transient, which means the state between builds is not preserved and the next build is started on a fresh build machine - basically, you don't need any clean-up logic in your build scripts.

AppVeyor has most popular services and database engines pre-installed on all build machines:

* [SQL Server 2008](#sql-server-2008)
* [SQL Server 2012](#sql-server-2012)
* [SQL Server 2014](#sql-server-2014)
* [SQL Server 2016](#sql-server-2016)
* [SQL Server 2017](#sql-server-2017)
* [MySQL](#mysql)
* [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)
* [MongoDB](#mongodb)
* [Internet Information Services](#internet-information-services)
* [Microsoft Message Queuing](#microsoft-message-queuing)

By default, their corresponding Windows services are stopped to reduce build machine boot time. On the **Environment** tab of project settings or in `appveyor.yml` you can configure which services must be started after the build machine has booted.

Also please note that all MS SQL servers use the same default port 1433. Therefore please start and stop them sequentially to avoid port conflicts. To allow all SQL Server instances to be started simultaneously, please run [this script](https://gist.github.com/FeodorFitsner/a7eba7f44f9becacd3abddca27974e93) at `init` stage.

### Importing your existing database

You can use the following PowerShell script to attach your own SQL Server database in `.MDF` format:

```powershell
$startPath = "$($env:appveyor_build_folder)\path-to-your-bin"
$sqlInstance = "(local)\SQL2012SP1"
$dbName = "MyDatabase"

# replace the db connection with the local instance
$config = join-path $startPath "MyTests.dll.config"
$doc = (gc $config) -as [xml]
$doc.SelectSingleNode('//connectionStrings/add[@name="store"]').connectionString = "Server=$sqlInstance; Database=$dbName; Trusted_connection=true"
$doc.Save($config)

# attach mdf to local instance
$mdfFile = join-path $startPath "store.mdf"
$ldfFile = join-path $startPath "store_log.ldf"
sqlcmd -S "$sqlInstance" -Q "Use [master]; CREATE DATABASE [$dbName] ON (FILENAME = '$mdfFile'),(FILENAME = '$ldfFile') for ATTACH"
```


### Enabling TCP/IP, Named Pipes and setting instance alias

```powershell
[reflection.assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo") | Out-Null
[reflection.assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("Microsoft.SqlServer.SqlWmiManagement") | Out-Null

$serverName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
$instanceName = 'SQL2008R2SP2'
$smo = 'Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.'
$wmi = new-object ($smo + 'Wmi.ManagedComputer')

# Enable TCP/IP
$uri = "ManagedComputer[@Name='$serverName']/ServerInstance[@Name='$instanceName']/ServerProtocol[@Name='Tcp']"
$Tcp = $wmi.GetSmoObject($uri)
$Tcp.IsEnabled = $true
$TCP.alter()

# Enable named pipes
$uri = "ManagedComputer[@Name='$serverName']/ ServerInstance[@Name='$instanceName']/ServerProtocol[@Name='Np']"
$Np = $wmi.GetSmoObject($uri)
$Np.IsEnabled = $true
$Np.Alter()

# Set Alias
New-Item HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Client -Name ConnectTo | Out-Null
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Client\ConnectTo -Name '(local)' -Value "DBMSSOCN,$serverName\$instanceName" | Out-Null

# Start services
Set-Service SQLBrowser -StartupType Manual
Start-Service SQLBrowser
Start-Service "MSSQL`$$instanceName"
```

<br/>

```bat
sqlcmd -S "(local)" -U "sa" -P "Password12!" -Q "SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;" -d "master"
```


## MySQL

MySQL 5.7 x64 database service is available on AppVeyor build workers.

* Path: `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7`
* Server name: `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`
* Server port: `3306`
* `root` password: `Password12!`

To start MySQL in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  - mysql
```

By default named pipes are not enabled for MySQL. If you need them, please add the following PowerShell statements at `install` stage:

```powershell
$iniPath="C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\my.ini"
$newText = ([System.IO.File]::ReadAllText($iniPath)).Replace("# enable-named-pipe", "enable-named-pipe")
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($iniPath, $newText)
Restart-Service MySQL57
```

This is an example how to supply MySql credentials to work with PowerShell tools:

```powershell
$env:MYSQL_PWD="Password12!"
$cmd = '"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin\mysql" -e "create database YourDatabase;" --user=root'
iex "& $cmd"
```

PATH=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin\;%PATH%
createdb YourDatabase
```
