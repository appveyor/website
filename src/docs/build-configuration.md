## Build pipeline

Every build goes through the following steps:

1. Run `init` scripts
2. **Clone** repository into clone folder
    * Checkout build commit
    * `cd` to clone folder
3. Restore build cache
4. Run `install` scripts
5. Patch `AssemblyInfo` and `.csproj` files
6. Modify `hosts` files
7. Start services
8. **Build**
    * Run `before_build` scripts
    * Run msbuild (or `build_script`)
    * Run `after_build` scripts
9. **Test**
    * Run `before_test` scripts
    * Discover and run tests (or `test_script`)
    * Run `after_test` scripts
10. **Package** artifacts
11. **Deployment**
    * Run `before_deploy` scripts
    * Run all configured deployments
    * Run `after_deploy` scripts
12. **Finalize** successful builds:
    * Run `on_success` scripts
    * Save build cache
13. **Finalize** failed builds:
    * Optionally save build cache
    * Run `on_failure` scripts
14. **Finalize** both successful and failed builds:
    * Call `on_finish` scripts

Note that you can forcibly terminate build with **success** from script with `appveyor exit` `cmd` command or `Exit-AppVeyorBuild` `PS` command. This can be done from any script *except* **Finalize** ones (`on_success`, `on_failure` and `on_finish`).

If you need to can forcibly terminate build with **failure** you can run any command with non-zero exit code, for example `exit 1` `cmd` command or `throw` `PS` command.

### Time limitations

All plans have 60 minutes quota per build job.


## Configuring build

Project builds can be configured by either `appveyor.yml` or on the user interface.

`appveyor.yml` is a project configuration file in YAML format that should be placed in the root of your repository.
At a minimum `appveyor.yml` is just an empty file.

Each method has pros and cons. Via the User interface one can control every aspect of the build process without ever touching the repository. On the other hand, YAML may seem more sophisticated and familiar for those coming from a Linux platform. Another thing to consider is that when you fork/clone a project with its configuration stored in `appveyor.yml`, you simply add a new project in AppVeyor referencing repo and you are good to go.

### appveyor.yml and UI coexistence

It's worth noticing that both `appveyor.yml` and UI configuration are mutually exclusive.
It's always either YAML or UI - the settings from each are not merged. If you have `appveyor.yml`
in your repo it will override all settings made on the UI unless explicitly disabled
by **Ignore appveyor.yml**. There are few exceptions, which are:

* Environment variables. Variables defined on UI are getting merged with those ones defined in `appveyor.yml`. Variable values with the same names are getting overridden with values from UI.
* Notification settings defined on UI are getting merged with those ones defined in `appveyor.yml`.
* Build version format is taken from UI if it is not set in `appveyor.yml`.

Some build configuration settings can be configured **only with UI**. They are not exposed with `appveyor.yml` for security reasons. It is possible to have both `appveyor.yml` and any of those UI setting. Those settings are in projects settings **General** tab. They are:

* Next build number
* Default branch
* Build priority
* Build timeout for private build cloud, minutes
* Custom commit status `context`
* Build schedule
* Ignore `appveyor.yml`
* Rolling builds *(and its sub-settings)*
* Enable secure variables in Pull Requests from the same repository only
* Enable deployments in Pull Requests *(available for private repos)*
* Save build cache in Pull Requests
* Always build closed Pull Request
* Do not build on "Push" events
* Do not build on "Pull request" events

### YAML file alternative naming

AppVeyor supports dot-file-style YAML named `.appveyor.yml` as is. Another custom name like `experimental.yml` is also possible, and can be specified in **Custom configuration .yml file name** setting.

### Alternative YAML file location

It is possible to keep YAML file outside of repository. For that place YAML file **as a plain text** (Content-Type: text/plain) and **anonymously accessible** at some HTTP (or HTTPS) location. If using some web hosting, let file has `.txt` extension for it to get correct content type. However better option is to use [permalink to GitHub gist raw file](https://gist.github.com/dragon788/dadcc5d1d1258b5d0d56), and take advantage of keeping file change history on GitHub.
After that place URL to YAML file to **Custom configuration .yml file name** setting. Needless to say that [secure variables](#secure-variables) should be used for secrets in YAML file.

### Generic Git repositories and YAML

Appveyor attempts to acquire appveyor.yml (or custom YAML name) from the repository before starting the build. This happens on central servers (not build workers) before any git clone happens. At that moment AppVeyor only needs the content of that one configuration file and so a full clone would be too expensive on central servers which are scheduling thousands of builds. Generic git does not have an option to check out an individual file, therefore we are using the APIs of source control providers who support this directly (like "Get contents" from GitHub).
At the moment those supported are: GitHub (hosted and on-premise), Bitbucket (hosted and on-premise), GitLab (hosted and on-premise), Azure DevOps, Kiln and Gitea. If you are using any other git source control provider, you will need to use [Alternative YAML file location](#alternative-yaml-file-location) described above.

### YAML format notes

While working with YAML there are few important points to be aware of:

* YAML format is sensitive to indentations that must be **spaces**. Do not use tabs to indent configuration sections.
* Section names in YAML are case-sensitive, so "deploy" and "Deploy" are different things in YAML.


## Build versioning

Every time you push changes into repo or click the **New build** button AppVeyor starts a new build with an incremented build number.

You may use the **build number** for versioning purposes (assemblies version patching, naming artifacts, etc.) or just use it for reference.

AppVeyor uses the **version** value for naming builds. You can have "through" builds numbering in which major and minor parts of the version are changing and the build number is never reset or you can reset the build number for every new version. In any case, while the build number could be reset to any previously used value, the *version must be unique* across all builds.

You can specify version format in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
version: '1.0.{build}'
```

## AssemblyInfo patching

AppVeyor has a built-in task for setting values in `AssemblyInfo` files during the build. This "patching" process is disabled by default for newly added projects.

You can enable patching on the **General** tab of project settings or in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
assembly_info:
  patch: true
  file: MyVersion.cs
  assembly_version: '{version}'
  assembly_file_version: '{version}'
  assembly_informational_version: '{version}-rc1'
```

**Note** that specific attribute like `AssemblyInformationalVersion` should exist in `AssemblyInfo` file to be patched.

Variables `{version}`, `{build}`, `{branch}` are shortcuts implemented specifically to use with patching. Use them exactly as described (in `{}` curly brackets).
You can use all other environment variables substitution in file name and version formats using standard environment variable notation, for example:

```yaml
package_version: $(APPVEYOR_BUILD_VERSION)
```

## .NET Core `.csproj` files patching

Like with [AssemblyInfo patching](#assemblyinfo-patching), AppVeyor can patch .NET Core `.csproj` files. This also applies to .NET Standard and ASP.NET Core `.csproj` files, which has the same new structure, different from classic .NET `.csproj` files. The main practical reason to patch those files is to set version to be used by **nuget packaging** of .NET Core and .NET Standard libraries (created in Visual Studio 2017, and probably later versions).

You can enable patching on the **General** tab of project settings or in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
dotnet_csproj:
  patch: true
  file: '**\*.csproj'
  version: '{version}'
  package_version: '{version}'
  assembly_version: '{version}'
  file_version: '{version}'
  informational_version: '{version}'
```

This section can also be used to patch `*.props`, `.fsproj` and `.xml` files side-by-side with `.csproj`:

```yaml
dotnet_csproj:
  patch: true
  file: '**\*.csproj;**\*.props;**\*.fsproj;**\*.xml'
  ...
```

**Note** that specific attribute like `PackageVersion` should exist in `.csproj` file to be patched.
**Note** that the xmlns must not be defined or else the file won't be processed.

Variables `{version}`, `{build}`, `{branch}` are shortcuts implemented specifically to use with patching. Use them exactly as described (in `{}` curly brackets).
You can use all other environment variables substitution in file name and version formats using standard environment variable notation, for example:

```yaml
package_version: $(APPVEYOR_BUILD_VERSION)
```

### Semantic versioning with version suffixes

The new `.csproj` format along with the dotnet CLI have added improved semantic versioning support for version suffixes.

With the command line:

    dotnet build My.sln --version-suffix "preview"

and `.csproj` containing:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <VersionPrefix>1.0.0</VersionPrefix>
</PropertyGroup>
```

enables the output of a project with the semantic version of `1.0.0-preview` while keeping the assembly version, file version, etc. in the correct format.

You can patch `<VersionPrefix>` element with the following configuration in YAML file:

```yaml
dotnet_csproj:
  patch: true
  file: '**\*.csproj'
  version_prefix: '{version}'
```

## Clone directory

The format of the default directory on the build machine for cloning a repository is `c:\projects\<project-slug>` on Windows and `/home/appveyor/projects/` on Ubuntu.

If required by your project (say, if absolute paths are used to reference its parts) you can change the clone directory path on the **Environment** tab of project settings or in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
clone_folder: c:\projects\myproject
```


## Environment variables

Immediately after cloning the repo on the build worker AppVeyor sets [standard environment variables](/docs/environment-variables/).

### Custom environment variables

Custom environment variables can be set on the **Environment** tab of project settings or in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  variable1: value
  variable2: value
```

### Interpreters and Scripts

AppVeyor allows you to choose between Command scripting and PowerShell scripting. If you are using the Command interpreter and batch files then prefix your script with `cmd:` as shown below. Do not use `command:`.

```yaml
test_script:
  - cmd: ECHO this is batch
```

If you are using the PowerShell then prefix your script with `ps:` as shown below. Do not use `powershell:`.

```yaml
test_script:
  - ps: Write-Host "This is PowerShell"
```

**Important:** If you are using a PowerShell script file like so:

```yaml
  - ps: build.ps1
```

It is important to be aware that the default behaviour in PowerShell is to continue on non-terminating errors. An example of a non-terminating error is when an external command returns a non-zero exit code. For example, you could be calling `dotnet.exe` in your script. If `dotnet.exe` fails, the script will continue and the build will still be reported as successful. To ensure the build fails when the script produces non-terminating errors, add the following line at the top of your script:

```PowerShell
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop";
```

### Setting environment variables in build script

CMD:

```bat
set MY_VARIABLE=value
```

Once a variable is set for a batch file you access it by `%MY_VARIABLE%`.

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:MY_VARIABLE="value"
```

Once a PowerShell variable is set you access it by `$env:MY_VARIABLE`. Do not use PowerShell syntax of `$MY_VARIABLE`.

### Secure variables

When you work with OSS projects and you’d like to hide some sensitive data from everyone’s eyes you can use **secure variables** in `appveyor.yml`.

AppVeyor generates a unique encryption key for every account. To encrypt variable values go to **Account &rarr; Encrypt YAML** page.

To use encrypted variable in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  my_variable:
    secure: <encrypt_value>
```

"Secure" variables means you can safely put them into `appveyor.yml` that is visible to others.
Other than that they are just regular environment variables in a build session that could be easily
displayed in a build log by simple `Get-ChildItem env:`.

However, **secure variables are *not* decoded during Pull Request** builds which prevents someone
from submitting PR with malicious build script displaying those variables. In more controlled
environment through with a trusted team and private GitHub repositories there is an option on
General tab of project settings to allow secure variables for PRs.

## Build mode

The build phase can operate in multiple modes. By default, AppVeyor works in `MSBuild` mode. This causes AppVeyor to look for a Visual Studio project or solution file in the root directory of your project, and use that to do the build. The behavior of an `MSBuild` mode build can be controlled by the `build:` entry in `appveyor.yml`.

The alternative to `MSBuild` mode is `Script` mode. This mode lets you do the build by running arbitrary scripted actions instead of building a Visual Studio project. `Script` mode can be activated in `appveyor.yml` by adding a `build_script:` section instead of a `build:` section. Alternatively, you can set `build: off` to disable `MSBuild` mode without providing an alternate custom build script.

If you are using AppVeyor UI (not YAML) configuration, all three options (`MSBuild`, `Script` and `Off`) are available in `Build` settings section.

## Script blocks in build configuration

There are a lot of places in configuration where you can inject your custom logic like "install" scripts, "before build", "after tests", "deploy" scripts, etc.

Every script could be authored either as a batch or PowerShell snippet.

When you set **Cmd** script on the UI its body will be split into lines and executed as separate commands with an exit code check after each line. For example, consider the following "install" script:

![install script cmd](/assets/img/docs/install-script-cmd.png)

If exit code of the first command (`gem update --system`) is different from a 0 script execution will be terminated and entire build will return as failed.

When **PS** (*PowerShell*) or **PS CORE** (*PowerShell Core*) is selected the entire body is treated as a single (*PowerShell* or *PowerShell Core*) script, so you can use control flow logic inside it. For example:

![build script ps](/assets/img/docs/build-script-ps.png)

![build script ps](/assets/img/docs/build-script-ps-core.png)

PowerShell script is considered successful if it finishes without exception.

If you need to check execution results of commands in the middle of PowerShell script you can verify `$LastExitCode` after calling
a command and terminate earlier, for example:

```powershell
vstest.console myassembly1.dll
if ($LastExitCode -ne 0) { $host.SetShouldExit($LastExitCode)  }

vstest.console myassembly2.dll
if ($LastExitCode -ne 0) { $host.SetShouldExit($LastExitCode)  }
```

There are a few ways of configuring scripts in `appveyor.yml`.

For example, this is the same configuration as shown on the first screenshot:

```yaml
install:
  - gem update --system
  - gem install rake
```

By default, script line is treated as batch command, but you can specify script engine explicitly:

```yaml
before_build:
  - cmd: ECHO this is batch
  - ps: Write-Host "This is PowerShell"
  - pwsh: Write-Host "This is PowerShell Core"
```

To add multi-line PowerShell script covering an entire event:

* note that indentation for lines after `- ps: |` should be at least 4 spaces longer

```yaml
on_success:
  - ps: |
      if ($true)
      {
        Write-Host "Success"
      }
```

This syntax is also valid:

* this kind of syntax is being auto-generated by **Export YAML** menu
* spaces between lines created by **Export YAML** menu are mandatory

```yaml
on_success:
- ps: >-
    if ($true)

    {
      Write-Host "Success"
    }
```

## Installing additional software

Every build runs on a pristine virtual machine that is not shared with any other builds. VM state is not preserved between builds.

You can install additional software on the build machine using Chocolatey, Web Platform Installer (Web PI) or PowerShell.

```yaml
install: <script>
```

or

```yaml
install:
  - cmd: rd temp
  - ps: Write-Host “Hello!”
```


### Chocolatey

```yaml
install:
  - cinst <package>
```


### PowerShell

```yaml
install:
  - ps: (new-object net.webclient).DownloadFile('https://mysite.com/mypackage.msi', 'mypackage.msi')
  - ps: msiexec /i mypackage.msi /quiet /qn /norestart /log install.log PROPERTY1=value1 PROPERTY2=value2
```

### WebPI Command Line

```yaml
install:
  - WebpiCmd /Install /Products:<Title or ID>
```


## Hosts entries

```yaml
hosts:
  localhost: 127.0.0.1
  db.server.com: 127.0.0.2
```


## Build matrix

Every AppVeyor *build* consists of one or more *jobs*. A build is considered successful if all jobs are successful. A build immediately fails when any of its jobs fail.

AppVeyor enables easy testing against multiple combinations of platforms, configurations and environments. Specify which operating systems, build configurations and platforms you would like to include into the build matrix
and AppVeyor will create a build with multiple jobs for all possible combinations.

Build matrix supports the following dimensions:

* **Operating system**
* **Environment variables**
* **Platform**, e.g. x86, x64, Any CPU
* **Configuration**, e.g. Build, Debug
* **Test categories**
* **Build cloud**

For example, selecting **x86, Any CPU** for Platform and **Debug, Release** for Configuration yields the build with the following jobs:

* x86, Debug
* x86, Release
* Any CPU, Debug
* Any CPU, Release

To configure build matrix in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  # these variables are common to all jobs
  common_var1: value1
  common_var2: value2

  matrix:
    # first group
    - db: mysql
      provider: mysql

    # second group
    - db: mssql
      provider: mssql
      password:
        secure: DHEU39J6X9VD376==

platform:
  - x86
  - Any CPU

configuration:
  - Debug
  - Release

matrix:
  fast_finish: true
```

### Failing strategy

By default AppVeyor **runs all** build jobs. If at least one job has failed the entire build is marked as failed. Sometimes, you want the build fail immediately once one of the job fails. To enable **fast fail** strategy add `fast_finish` setting into `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
matrix:
  fast_finish: true
```

### Allow failing jobs

You can configure AppVeyor to allow certain build matrix rows to fail and still continue with the rest of the build. *The result of these failing jobs is not counted towards build status*. This may be useful if you are experimenting with running tests on the latest version of a platform or framework, e.g. Node.js 0.11.

To allow failing jobs add `matrix.allow_failures` section into `appveyor.yml` (the feature is not available on UI):

```yaml
matrix:
  allow_failures:
    - <condition>: <value>
```

`<condition>` can be `os`, `image`, `configuration`, `platform`, `test_category` or the name of environment variable.

For example, to allow job failing on Node.js 0.11 ([see Node.js instructions](/docs/lang/nodejs-iojs/)):

```yaml
matrix:
  allow_failures:
    - nodejs_version: 0.11
```

The following example allows failure for `platform=x86, configuration=Debug` and `platform=x64, configuration=Release` jobs:

```yaml
matrix:
  allow_failures:
    - platform: x86
      configuration: Debug
    - platform: x64
      configuration: Release
```

The matrix is already optimized for fast failing. The logic is as follows:

* If a job that does not allow failure has failed the build fails.
* If a job that does allow failure has failed and the rest of jobs allow failures the build fails.

See [complete appveyor.yml reference](/docs/appveyor-yml/) for full syntax.

### Exclude configuration from the matrix

It is possible to exclude configuration from the matrix. Syntax is the same as for `allow_failures` (this feature is also YAML-only and not available in UI currently).

Please consider the following example:

```yaml
configuration:
- Debug
- Release

environment:
  matrix:
    - MY_VAR: A
    - MY_VAR: B

matrix:
  exclude:
    - configuration: Debug
      MY_VAR: B
```

Here we have 2 matrix dimensions: configurations and variables and each has 2 values. Therefore by default it should be 2X2=4 build jobs. But if combination of `configuration: Debug` and `MY_VAR: B` is not needed, we can exclude it. In comparison with `allow_failures` build will not be even started for this combination.

We still recommend use `allow_failures` for "unstable" cases which should be built but should not affect build results, and use `exclude` for cases where build should be completely skipped.

### Specializing matrix job configuration

By default, all build matrix jobs share the same configuration. However there are cases when build scenario should be different for each matrix job. This become especially handful for multi-platform builds. For example, build should run in `MSBuild` mode for all build worker images, but run a build script for `Ubuntu` one. This can be done with the following YAML configuration:

```yaml
image:
  - Visual Studio 2017
  - Ubuntu
build:
  project: src
  publish_wap: true
  verbosity: minimal

for:
-
  matrix:
    only:
      - image: Ubuntu

  build_script:
  - echo Ubuntu build script
```

Also `except` syntax is supported:

```yaml
﻿configuration:
  - Debug
  - Release

platform:
  - x86
  - Any CPU

test_script:
  - echo common script

for:
-
  matrix:
    except:
      - configuration: Debug
        platform: x86

  test_script:
  - echo matrix except script
```

YAML syntax to describe specific matrix job is the same as `allow_failures` and `exclude`, but it should be placed under the `for` construct, similar to [sharing common configuration between branches](/docs/branches#sharing-common-configuration-between-branches).

**Settings to be ignored:**

Here is a list of settings which **will be ignored** if placed under `for.matrix.only/.except` construct:

* `version`
* any matrix dimensions
* any other matrix settings like `allow_failures`, `exclude` and `fast_finish`
* another `for` construct
* `pull_requests.do_not_increment_build_number`
* `max_jobs`
* `nuget.account_feed.project_feed.disable_publish_on_pr`
* `nuget.account_feed.project_feed.publish_wap_octopus`

Therefore this YAML will be executed, but **no special configuration** for any matrix job will be formed:

```yaml
﻿configuration:
  - Debug
  - Release

for:
-
  version: 22.33.{build}
  matrix:
    only:
      - configuration: Debug
    fast_finish: true
    allow_failures:
      - nodejs_version: 0.11
    pull_requests:
      do_not_increment_build_number: true
```

**Settings to be merged:**

* environment variables from matrix job configuration will be merged with environment variables from common configuration. Variables with the same name will be overwritten with value from matrix job configuration
* Notifications will be merged
* All other settings will be overwritten with value from matrix job configuration

### Skip matrix jobs conditionally

With [specializing matrix job configuration](/docs/build-configuration#specializing-matrix-job-configuration) you can also conditionally skip specific matrix jobs. It is possible because [branches white- and blacklisting](/docs/branches#white--and-blacklisting), tags filtering with `skip_tags: true` or `skip_non_tags: true`, and all [commit filtering settings](/docs/how-to/filtering-commits) are valid in `for.matrix.only/.except` construct. Examples:

Skip build job with configuration `Config1` on commits to `master`:

```yaml
configuration:
  - Config1
  - Config2
  - Config3

for:
-
  matrix:
    only:
      - configuration: Config1

  branches:
    except:
    - master
```

Skip  build job with image `Ubuntu` when all changes files are in `docs` folder:

```yaml
image:
  - Visual Studio 2017
  - Ubuntu

for:
-
  matrix:
    only:
      - image: Ubuntu

  skip_commits:
    files:
      - docs/*
```

## Rolling builds

"Rolling builds" are great for very active OSS projects with lengthy queue. Whenever you do a new commit to the same branch *OR* pull request all current queued/running builds for that branch or PR are cancelled and the new one is queued. Other words, rolling builds make sure that only the most recent commit is built.

For example, you do commit `A` to `master` branch - it's being queued and then run. Then you do `B` commit to `master` branch while `A` is running - build of `A` will be cancelled immediately and `B` is queued. If you do another `C` commit while `B` is queued it will be cancelled and `C` queued.

(Note that "Rolling builds" can only be enabled in the settings UI of a project and not via `appveyor.yml` and that the presence of `appveyor.yml` does not disable this UI setting.)

## Scheduled builds

AppVeyor uses [NCrontab library](https://github.com/atifaziz/NCrontab) to calculate a build schedule.

Schedule hour values should be UTC.

External links:

* [Crontab expression syntax](https://github.com/atifaziz/NCrontab/wiki/Crontab-Expression)
* [Crontab examples](https://github.com/atifaziz/NCrontab/wiki/Crontab-Examples)


## Build queue

Sometimes you may wonder why your build is not being run immediately or remains in `Queued` state longer than usual.

This is how builds scheduling works.

First, the maximum number of build jobs running simultaneously is defined by account plan. For example, for Free, Basic and Pro it's 1 concurrent job, for Premium it's 2. Also, there are a lot of additional plans with greater number of concurrent build jobs available on billing page.

It is important to understand that concurrent build jobs limit is account level setting. So, if some project consumes all concurrent build jobs defined in plan, builds for other projects in the same account wait in queue. To prevent specific project from consuming number of jobs higher than specific number, please use **Max jobs** (UI) or `max_jobs` (YAML) setting.

If there are no running builds under your account, you might see the build is in `Starting` state for longer than usual time. It can happen that VM assigned to a build is still being provisioned. We maintain our own Hyper-V based infrastructure with pre-heated VMs, and if a build is assigned to pre-provisioned machine it should start almost instantly. However, if own infrastructure is under heavy load or we do some servicing work, then new builds start on backup cloud which we run on Google Cloud Engine. Also some specific build images as `Visual Studio 2013` and different `Ubuntu` images run mostly on Google Cloud Engine. In this case VM is being created from scratch. Usually, it should take no longer than 3-4 minutes.


### Builds prioritization

When a lot of commits are made by your team during the day there are multiple builds awaiting in "queued" state. It is possible to move up and down certain builds in a queue by changing their projects' priority. **Build priority** setting is located on General tab of project settings. When priority is not set builds are not prioritized. When priority is set builds in a queue are in ascending order. The higher number - the lower priority; the highest priority is 1. Builds with priority has precedence over those ones without it.

As a real-world example, suppose we have three projects: A, B and C. We want builds of project A always come first, then builds of project B and the rest in FIFO order. We set project A build priority to 1 (the highest priority) and project B priority to 2. Then we did commits in the following order (provided our account allows only one concurrent job and first build of project C is still running):

    C (no priority) - 1 - running
    C (no priority) - 2 - queued
    B (priority 2)  - 1 - queued
    A (priority 1)  - 1 - queued
    B (priority 2)  - 2 - queued

Build queue will look as below:

    C (no priority) - 1 - running
    A (priority 1)  - 1 - queued    <-- this build comes next
    B (priority 2)  - 1 - queued
    B (priority 2)  - 2 - queued
    C (no priority) - 2 - queued


### Build timeout

Default timeout for build job is 60 minutes. If you need to decrease it, you can set **Build timeout, minutes** to the smaller value. Note that decrease to less than 5 minutes will not apply.
If you run your builds on [private build cloud](/docs/build-environment/#private-build-cloud), you can increase build timeout, otherwise increase will not apply.
