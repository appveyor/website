Azure Cloud Service deployment provider assumes there is only one **Azure Cloud Service package** (file with `.cspkg` extension) in build artifacts and at least one **Azure Cloud Service configuration** artifact (file with `.cscfg` extension).


## Automatic packaging

To build Azure CS project and automatically push it as artifact enable **Publish Azure Cloud Service projects** option on **Build** tab of project settings.

To enable packaging of Azure CS projects in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
build:
  publish_azure: true
```

AppVeyor will find Azure Cloud Service project (`.ccproj`) and package it. Created Cloud Service package (`<project-name>.cspkg`) and default "Cloud" configuration (`<project-name>.cscfg`) will be published to build artifacts. In addition to that **all** `.cscfg` files found in Cloud Service project folder are pushed to artifacts with names `<project-name>.<config>.cscfg`. Build artifacts page would look like below:

![azure-cloud-service-artifacts](/assets/img/docs/azure-cloud-service-artifacts.png)

If you get `error WAT200: No default service configuration "ServiceConfiguration.cscfg" could be found in the project`
build error while using automatic package then you should define `TargetProfile`
environment variable with the name of configuration you'd like to build:

    environment:
      TargetProfile: <your-target-profile-name>


## Packaging from script

To build Azure Cloud Service package from the script you can use the following command:

    msbuild <azure-cs-project>.ccproj /t:Publish /p:PublishDir=%APPVEYOR_BUILD_FOLDER% /p:TargetProfile=<config>

To push package and configuration to artifacts:

    appveyor PushArtifact <azure-cs-project>.cspkg
    appveyor PushArtifact ServiceConfiguration.<config>.cscfg -FileName <azure-cs-project>.cscfg

Replace `<azure-cs-project>` with the name of your Azure CS project and `<config>`
with the name of target configuration, e.g. `Cloud`, `Local`.


## Configuring deployment

Sample `appveyor.yml` configuration:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: AzureCS
  subscription_id: 0C8CCAAC-03F4-4659-B927-EFAB8874BE8D
  subscription_certificate:
    secure: WJjB4oIJKDRXRkaP2hB5Dnoaq1AXOPxf/d2gs0M0Pu6kW0SFBOVw ... z9SVqWcnozkHxylgwaaFA==
  storage_account_name: mystorage
  storage_access_key:
    secure: XMdn4xfPcYlZFYgvbytc8Q==
  service: myazure-service
  slot: production
  deployment_label: $(appveyor_build_version)
  artifact: myservice.cspkg
  target_profile: Cloud   # optional .cscfg configuration name to deploy with
  do_not_start_deployment: false
  recreate_deployment: false
```

To get `subscription_id` and `subscription_certificate` [download publish settings and subscription for your Azure account](https://manage.windowsazure.com/publishsettings)
and then grab both values from downloaded `<subscription>.publishsettings` XML file.


## Cloud Service Deploy Parametrization

When deploying Cloud Services to different environments you don't want to re-build application package every time with different configurations, but you want to deploy the same package (artifact) with some environment-specific settings configured during deployment. When using Cloud Service Deploy the problem can be easily solved by Cloud Service Deploy parametrization.

### Setting parameters during deployment

Cloud Service Deploy provider analyzes the deployment package and looks into environment variables to set parameter values with matching names.

Variable should be in format `<role_name>.<setting_name>`. For example if your .cscfg contains the folloing:

```xml
<Role name="FrontEnd">
  <Instances count="3" />
  <ConfigurationSettings>
    <Setting name="ConnectionString" value="" />
  </ConfigurationSettings>
</Role>
```

Environment variable name should be `FrontEnd.ConnectionString`.

When promoting specific build from Environment page you set variables on environment settings page:

![environment-variables](/assets/img/docs/deployment/web-deploy/environment-variables.png)

When deploying during the build session environment variables are used instead. You can set build environment variables on Environment tab of project settings, `appveyor.yml` or programmatically during the build.

![project-environment-variables](/assets/img/docs/deployment/web-deploy/project-environment-variables.png)

Variables defined during the build override those ones defined on Environment level.

### Deployment Upgrade Mode

AppVeyor exposes [DeploymentUpgradeMode Enumeration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.windowsazure.management.compute.models.deploymentupgrademode.aspx) with "tweak" environment variable called `APPVEYOR_ACS_DEPLOYMENT_UPGRADE_MODE`. Default value is `Auto`. Set it to `Manual` or `Simultaneous` if different behavior is required.
