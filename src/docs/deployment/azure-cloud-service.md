Azure Cloud Service deployment provider assumes there is only one **Azure Cloud Service package** (file with `.cspkg` extension) in build artifacts and at least one **Azure Cloud Service configuration** artifact (file with `.cscfg` extension).


## Automatic packaging

To build Azure CS project and automatically push it as artifact enable **Publish Azure Cloud Service projects** option on **Build** tab of project settings.

To enable packaging of Azure CS projects in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
build:
  publish_azure: true
```

AppVeyor will find Azure Cloud Service project (`.ccproj`) and package it. Created Cloud Service package (`<project-name>.cspkg`) and default "Cloud" configuration (`<project-name>.cscfg`) will be published to build artifacts. In addition to that **all** `.cscfg` files found in Cloud Service project folder are pushed to artifacts with names `<project-name>.<config>.cscfg`. Build artifacts page would look like below:

![azure-cloud-service-artifacts](/assets/img/docs/azure-cloud-service-artifacts.png)

If you get `error WAT200: No default service configuration "ServiceConfiguration.cscfg" could be found in the project`
build error while using automatic package then you should define `TargetProfile`
environment variable with the name of configuration you'd like to build:

    environment:
      TargetProfile: <your-target-profile-name>


## Packaging from script

To build Azure Cloud Service package from the script you can use the following command:

    msbuild <azure-cs-project>.ccproj /t:Publish /p:PublishDir=%APPVEYOR_BUILD_FOLDER% /p:TargetProfile=<config>

To push package and configuration to artifacts:

    appveyor PushArtifact <azure-cs-project>.cspkg
    appveyor PushArtifact ServiceConfiguration.<config>.cscfg -FileName <azure-cs-project>.cscfg

Replace `<azure-cs-project>` with the name of your Azure CS project and `<config>`
with the name of target configuration, e.g. `Cloud`, `Local`.


## Configuring deployment

Sample `appveyor.yml` configuration:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: AzureCS
  subscription_id: 0C8CCAAC-03F4-4659-B927-EFAB8874BE8D
  subscription_certificate:
    secure: WJjB4oIJKDRXRkaP2hB5Dnoaq1AXOPxf/d2gs0M0Pu6kW0SFBOVw ... z9SVqWcnozkHxylgwaaFA==
  storage_account_name: mystorage
  storage_access_key:
    secure: XMdn4xfPcYlZFYgvbytc8Q==
  service: myazure-service
  slot: production
  deployment_label: $(APPVEYOR_BUILD_VERSION)
  artifact: myservice.cspkg
  target_profile: Cloud   # optional .cscfg configuration name to deploy with
  do_not_start_deployment: false
  recreate_deployment: false
```

To get `subscription_id` of your Azure subscription navigate to **Subscriptions** blade in Azure Portal.

The following section explains how to configure Azure management certificate and get the value of `subscription_certificate` setting.

## Generating Azure management certificate

AppVeyor uses "classic" Service Management API to manage Azure Cloud Service resources. X509 certificate required for Service Management API authentication.
In the current Azure Portal there is no built-in functionality to download pre-generated management certificate, but, instead, it should be generated by developer and uploaded to portal in `.cer` format.

To generate certificate on your developer machine you will need [OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) and PowerShell.

Open PowerShell and run the following commands:

```posh
# generate new certificate and export it in both PFX and CER formats
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName management.azure.cloudapp.net -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My" -KeyLength 2048 -KeySpec "KeyExchange"
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "Password12" -Force -AsPlainText
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -FilePath ".\azure-manage-cert.pfx" -Password $password
Export-Certificate -Type CERT -Cert $cert -FilePath .\azure-manage-cert.cer

# remove password from PFX certificate
openssl pkcs12 -in azure-manage-cert.pfx -password pass:Password12 -nodes -out temp.pem
openssl pkcs12 -export -in temp.pem -passout pass: -out azure-manage-cert.pfx
del temp.pem

# convert PFX certificate to Base64 string
[Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path ".\azure-manage-cert.pfx" -Encoding Byte)) | Out-File ".\azure-manage-cert.pfx.txt"
```

In Azure Portal navigate to **Subscriptions &rarr; &lt;your subscription&gt; &rarr; Management certificates** and upload `azure-manage-cert.cer`.

Contents of `azure-manage-cert.pfx.txt` is the value of `subscription_certificate` deployment provider setting. [Encrypt](https://ci.appveyor.com/tools/encrypt) that string before inserting into your `appveyor.yml`.

## Cloud Service Deploy Parametrization

When deploying Cloud Services to different environments you don't want to re-build application package every time with different configurations, but you want to deploy the same package (artifact) with some environment-specific settings configured during deployment. When using Cloud Service Deploy the problem can be easily solved by Cloud Service Deploy parametrization.

### Setting parameters during deployment

Cloud Service Deploy provider analyzes the deployment package and looks into environment variables to set parameter values with matching names.

Variable should be in format `<role_name>.<setting_name>`. For example if your .cscfg contains the folloing:

```xml
<Role name="FrontEnd">
  <Instances count="3" />
  <ConfigurationSettings>
    <Setting name="ConnectionString" value="" />
  </ConfigurationSettings>
</Role>
```

Environment variable name should be `FrontEnd.ConnectionString`.

When promoting specific build from Environment page you set variables on environment settings page:

![environment-variables](/assets/img/docs/deployment/cloud-service/environment-variables.png)

When deploying during the build session environment variables are used instead. You can set build environment variables on Environment tab of project settings, `appveyor.yml` or programmatically during the build.

![project-environment-variables](/assets/img/docs/deployment/cloud-service/project-environment-variables.png)

Variables defined during the build override those ones defined on Environment level.

### Deployment Upgrade Mode

AppVeyor exposes [DeploymentUpgradeMode Enumeration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.windowsazure.management.compute.models.deploymentupgrademode.aspx) with "tweak" environment variable called `APPVEYOR_ACS_DEPLOYMENT_UPGRADE_MODE`. Default value is `Auto`. Set it to `Manual` or `Simultaneous` if different behavior is required.
