## Overview

The fact AppVeyor deployment requires build artifacts on input makes deployment
process predictable and repeatable.

AppVeyor allows you to deploy using multiple providers **as part of the build process**
(inline deployment) as well as **promote builds to existing environments** (environment deployment).

**Inline deployment** runs as the last phase in the [build pipeline](/docs/build-configuration#build-pipeline)
and allows configuring multiple deployments running synchronously one-by-one with results in build console.

**Environment deployment** is triggered manually or through API to deploy "green" build to existing environment.
A new deployment is registered within a project/environment with results in deployment console.
If you don't have any existing environments, you can create one at <https://ci.appveyor.com/environments>.

The table below summarizes key differences between two modes with lists of deployment
providers available in each mode:

## Environment variables in provider settings

You can use standard and custom environment variables in provider settings, for example
you can set remote FTP folder as `$(appveyor_build_version)\artifacts` where `$(appveyor_build_version)`
will be replaced with current build version.


## Conditional deployment

When you deploy as part of the build process you can control under which conditions
deployment should be run.

By default, AppVeyor deploys from all branches, but you can include only specific branches.
Also, you can use any environment variables to have more complex conditions.

For example, to deploy from "master" branch and only artifacts built for "x86" platform
(`platform` is the name of environment variable):

```yaml
- provider: Environment
  name: production
  on:
    branch: master
    platform: x86
```

## Deploy on tag (GitHub and GitLab only)

By default AppVeyor starts a new build on any push to GitHub whether it's regular commit or a new tag.
Repository tagging frequently used to trigger deployment.

AppVeyor sets `APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG` environment variable to distinguish regular commits from tags -
the value is `true` if tag was pushed; otherwise it's `false`. When it's `true` the name of tag
is stored in `APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG_NAME`.

You can use `APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG` variable to trigger deployment on tag only, for example
(for Environment provider):

```yaml
- provider: Environment
  name: production
  on:
    appveyor_repo_tag: true
```

You can disable builds on new tags through UI (General tab of project settings) or in `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
skip_tags: true
```
