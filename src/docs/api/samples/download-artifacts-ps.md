# Downloading AppVeyor build artifacts (PowerShell - basic example)

```powershell
$apiUrl = 'https://ci.appveyor.com/api'
$token = '<your-api-token>'
$headers = @{
  "Authorization" = "Bearer $token"
  "Content-type" = "application/json"
}
$accountName = '<your-account-name>'
$projectSlug = '<your-project-slug>'

$downloadLocation = 'C:\projects'

# get project with last build details
$project = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$apiUrl/projects/$accountName/$projectSlug" -Headers $headers

# we assume here that build has a single job
# get this job id
$jobId = $project.build.jobs[0].jobId

# get job artifacts (just to see what we've got)
$artifacts = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$apiUrl/buildjobs/$jobId/artifacts" -Headers $headers

# here we just take the first artifact, but you could specify its file name
# $artifactFileName = 'MyWebApp.zip'
$artifactFileName = $artifacts[0].fileName

# artifact will be downloaded as
$localArtifactPath = "$downloadLocation\$artifactFileName"

# download artifact
# -OutFile - is local file name where artifact will be downloaded into
# the Headers in this call should only contain the bearer token, and no Content-type, otherwise it will fail!
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$apiUrl/buildjobs/$jobId/artifacts/$artifactFileName" `
-OutFile $localArtifactPath
```
