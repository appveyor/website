## Installation

Several Ruby versions are already preinstalled
(see [details](/docs/installed-software#ruby)).
We only need to add one of it to a PATH.

```yaml
# appveyor.yml
install:
  - set PATH=C:\Ruby22\bin;%PATH%
  - bundle install

build: off

before_test:
  - ruby -v
  - gem -v
  - bundle -v

test_script:
  - bundle exec rake
```

## Build matrix

Rubies can be used with build matrix:

```yaml
version: 1.0.{build}-{branch}

environment:
  matrix:
    - RUBY_VERSION: 22
    - RUBY_VERSION: 21
    - RUBY_VERSION: 200
    - RUBY_VERSION: 193

install:
  - set PATH=C:\Ruby%RUBY_VERSION%\bin;%PATH%
  - bundle install

build: off

before_test:
  - ruby -v
  - gem -v
  - bundle -v

test_script:
  - bundle exec rake
```

Add 64-bit Rubies as `200-x64`, `21-x64` etc. Do not use `Platform: x64`.

## Caching

Ruby's gems can be easily cached by AppVeyor,
but they are installed into long and complex path,
like `C:\Ruby21\lib\ruby\gems\2.1.0\gems`.

One should better force Bundler to put gems into well know path, eg:

```yaml
version: 1.0.{build}-{branch}

cache:
  - vendor/bundle

environment:
  matrix:
    - RUBY_VERSION: 22
    - RUBY_VERSION: 21
    - RUBY_VERSION: 200
    - RUBY_VERSION: 193

install:
  - set PATH=C:\Ruby%RUBY_VERSION%\bin;%PATH%
  - bundle config --local path vendor/bundle
  - bundle install

build: off

before_test:
  - ruby -v
  - gem -v
  - bundle -v

test_script:
  - bundle exec rake
```

## Build Worker API

AppVeyor offers [API](/docs/build-worker-api) for reporting during build process.

It was implemented in
[appveyor-worker](https://rubygems.org/gems/appveyor-worker) gem.

Just include it into your project's Gemfile.
Progress of your tests will be automagically displayed on project build page
in real time and stack traces (for failed tests)
will become available thru web-interface.

You can also send messages and set environment variables from your tests.
