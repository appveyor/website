## Previous worker images

There are build worker images available from previous deployment. You can use them in case of any issues with the current images:

* `Previous Visual Studio 2013`
* `Previous Visual Studio 2015`
* `Previous Visual Studio 2017`

You can select build worker image in "Build worker image" dropdown on Environment tab of project settings or if you use `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
os: Previous Visual Studio 2015
```
