This is a major Ubuntu images update that might break some builds. Changes at a glance:

* **Ubuntu 20.04** (Focal Fossa) image;
* **Qt** is now pre-installed on all Ubuntu images;
* **.NET Core SDKs** are unified across Ubuntu images with outdated versions removed;
* **LLVM 10** is now pre-installed on all images;
* Updated versions of **Node.js, Golang, Ruby, Python** and other frameworks and tools;
* Image baking scripts were cleaned up and improved to be more consistent across multiple Ubuntu versions.

## Ubuntu 20.04

`ubuntu2004` image is available now. Give it a try and let us know how it worked!

While we were able to pre-install most of the software available on 16.04 and 18.04 images Ubuntu 20.04 is still quite new OS and some packages are not ready, or not compatible, or work with quirks:

* PowerShell - [manually installed](https://github.com/appveyor/build-images/blob/master/scripts/Ubuntu/focal.sh#L33) to `/opt/microsoft/powershell/7-focal` with `/usr/bin/pwsh` link;
* .NET Core SDKs were installed from 18.04 feed with [hack](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4360#issuecomment-619598884). Manual way is [also possible](https://dev.to/carlos487/installing-dotnet-core-in-ubuntu-20-04-6jh).
* .NET Core SDKs 2.1.202 and 1.1.14 were not installed because of OpenSSL 1.0 dependency;
* VirtualBox is installed from Bionic repo, but the test is not passing;
* RVM was not able to pull/build Ruby 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3;
* Mono 6.10.0.103 installed from Preview channel;
* Microsoft SQL Server is not supported on Ubuntu 20.04 yet;
* Azure CLI installed from Bionic repo;
* Firefox installed from Bionic repo.

## Qt

Qt is now pre-installed on all Ubuntu images.

There are two versions available:

* 5.14.2 in `$HOME/Qt/5.14.2/gcc_64/bin`
* 5.12.8 in `$HOME/Qt/5.12.8/gcc_64/bin`

[A simple example of Qt build](https://github.com/appveyor-tests/qt-linux)

Similar to Windows images there are links created for latest and major versions:

* `$HOME/Qt/latest`
* `$HOME/Qt/5.14`
* `$HOME/Qt/5.12`

## Python

Starting this image update we are going to mainain only the latest patch version of every Python release. Also, we are adding "minor" links to the latest patches.

"2.6.9" "2.7.18" "3.4.10" "3.5.9" "3.6.10" "3.7.7" "3.8.2" "3.9.0a6"

* Python 3.9.0a6: `$HOME/venv3.9.0` and `$HOME/venv3.9`
* Python 3.8.2: `$HOME/venv3.8.2` and `$HOME/venv3.8`
* Python 3.7.7: `$HOME/venv3.7.7` and `$HOME/venv3.7`
* Python 3.6.10: `$HOME/venv3.6.10` and `$HOME/venv3.6`
* Python 3.5.9: `$HOME/venv3.5.9` and `$HOME/venv3.5`

* Python 2.6.9: `$HOME/venv2.6.9` and `$HOME/venv2.6`

Use `stack: python <version>` in `appveyor.yml` to activate required Python virtual environment, for example: `stack: python 3.8`.
