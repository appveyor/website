## Previous worker images

There are build worker images available from previous deployment. You can use them in case of any issues with the current images:

- `Previous Windows Server 2012 R2`
- `Previous Unstable`
- `Previous Visual Studio 2014 CTP4`
- `Previous Visual Studio 2015 CTP`
- `Previous Visual Studio 2015 CTP 6`
- `Previous Visual Studio 2015 Preview`
- `Previous MinGW`

You can select build worker image in OS dropdown on Environment tab of project settings or if you use `appveyor.yml`:

{% highlight yaml %}
os: Previous Windows Server 2012 R2
{% endhighlight %}

> **Note to "Pro" customers:** Whenever custom build worker image is chosen the build will run on Azure, so there is about 3-4 minutes delay before build starts to provision build worker virtual machine.
