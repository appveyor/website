## Build worker updates

* `Node.js 0.10.38`, `Node.js 0.12.2` x86 and x64 added. Use `Install-Product node 0` cmdlet to switch runtime to the latest Node.js version or `Install-Product node 0.10` to the latest 0.10.x build.
    * Node.js 0.10.38 x86 is default Node.js in `PATH`
* **Azure SDK 2.5.1**
* [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9abe329c-9bba-44a1-be59-0fbf6151054d) extension installed (`.vdproj` support).
* [Bundler 1.9.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler/versions/1.9.2) is pre-installed to all Rubies.
* **Python 2.7.9** replaces Python 2.7.8 in `C:\Python27` and `C:\Python27-x64`.
* **Python 3.4.3** replaces Python 3.4.1 in `C:\Python34` and `C:\Python34-x64`.

## Previous worker images

There are build worker images available from previous deployment. You can use them in case of any issues with the current images:

* `Previous Windows Server 2012 R2`
* `Previous Unstable`
* `Previous Visual Studio 2014 CTP4`
* `Previous Visual Studio 2015 CTP`
* `Previous Visual Studio 2015 CTP 6`
* `Previous Visual Studio 2015 Preview`
* `Previous MinGW`

You can select build worker image in OS dropdown on Environment tab of project settings or if you use `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
os: Previous Windows Server 2012 R2
```

**Note to "Pro" customers**: Whenever custom build worker image is chosen the build will run on Azure, so there is about 3-4 minutes delay before build starts to provision build worker virtual machine.
