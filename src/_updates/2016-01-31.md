## Slack notification breaking changes

There was a [bug in Slack notification provider](https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues/623) when AppVeyor was always prepending channel name with `#`
and preventing sending notifications to private channels. Now, when that bug is fixed and AppVeyor is not adding `#` to a channel name anymore you
may need to update your Slack notification settings to make sure public channel name starts with `#`. In `appveyor.yml` you need to quote channel name
to pass YAML validation, for example:

{% highlight yaml %}
- provider: Slack
  auth_token:
    secure: AAABBB+CCC==
  channel: '#channel'
{% endhighlight %}

## Previous worker images

There are build worker images available from previous deployment. You can use them in case of any issues with the current images:

- `Previous Windows Server 2012 R2`
- `Previous Visual Studio 2015`

You can select build worker image in OS dropdown on Environment tab of project settings or if you use `appveyor.yml`:

{% highlight yaml %}
os: Previous Windows Server 2012 R2
{% endhighlight %}
