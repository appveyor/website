## Previous worker images

There are build worker images available from previous deployment. You can use them in case of any issues with the current images:

- `Previous Windows Server 2012 R2`
- `Previous Visual Studio 2015`

You can select build worker image in OS dropdown on Environment tab of project settings or if you use `appveyor.yml`:

{% highlight yaml %}
os: Previous Windows Server 2012 R2
{% endhighlight %}
