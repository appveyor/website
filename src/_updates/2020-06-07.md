## Previous worker images

There are build worker images available from previous deployment. You can use them in case of any issues with the current images:

* `Previous macOS`
* `Previous macOS-Mojave`

You can select build worker image in "Build worker image" dropdown on Environment tab of project settings or if you use `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
image: Previous macos
```
