## What's new

Appveyor now supports builds on the current LTS Ubuntu version 22.04("jammy")!

Check [here](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/linux-images-software) for a list of pre-installed software on build images.

You can choose the new worker image in your `appveyor.yml` config file as follows:

```yaml
image: Ubuntu2204
```
