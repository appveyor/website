## Previous worker images

There are build worker images available from previous deployment. You can use them in case of any issues with the current images:

* `Previous Windows Server 2012 R2`
* `Previous Unstable`
* `Previous Visual Studio 2014 CTP4`
* `Previous Visual Studio 2015 CTP`
* `Previous Visual Studio 2015 CTP 6`
* `Previous Visual Studio 2015 Preview`
* `Previous MinGW`

You can select build worker image in OS dropdown on Environment tab of project settings or if you use `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
os: Previous Windows Server 2012 R2
```

**Note to "Pro" customers**: Whenever custom build worker image is chosen the build will run on Azure, so there is about 3-4 minutes delay before build starts to provision build worker virtual machine.
