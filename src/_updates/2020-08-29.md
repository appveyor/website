## Previous worker image

There is a build worker image available from previous deployment. You can use it in case of any issues with the current image:

`Previous Visual Studio 2019`

You can select build worker image in "Build worker image" dropdown on Environment tab of project settings or if you use `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
image: Previous Visual Studio 2019
```
