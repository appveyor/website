## Previous worker images

There are build worker images available from previous deployment. You can use them in case of any issues with the current images:

* `Previous Visual Studio 2019`
* `Previous Visual Studio 2022`

You can select build worker image in "Build worker image" dropdown on Environment tab of project settings or if you use `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
image: Previous Visual Studio 2022
```

This release also comes with an end date of AppVeyor's support for the following software on these images:

* MinGW 32-bit 5.3.0
* Android SDK 4.4, 5.0, 5.1

**As of the next image update the above libraries will no longer be available. Please update your build configurations accordingly, bearing in mind that you can switch your configuration to use `previous` image to extend the use of the removed software if need be.**
