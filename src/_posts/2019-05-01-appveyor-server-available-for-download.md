title: AppVeyor Server is available for download

Today we are excited to announce the release of AppVeyor Server - multi-platform downloadable version of AppVeyor CI service!

We've come a long way refactoring the original codebase from .NET Framework to .NET Core to be able to install it on Windows, Linux and Mac. As a result you've got a light-weight dependency-free CI/CD server that can be scaled from a simple build server for a team to a high-availability deployment on Kubernetes covering all CI/CD needs of entire organization.

Despite such a drastic change in the heart (and on UI), it is still the same beloved AppVeyor supporting all the features that you enjoy in hosted CI: YAML configuration, build matrices, NuGet feeds, deployments and more.

This first release also has some unique features:

* Deep integration with Docker for Windows. You can run Windows and Linux builds in parallel.
* Job groups and dependencies to model complex workflows with fan-in/-out scenarios.

AppVeyor Server comes in 3 editions:

* Community Edition - one user; **FREE**.
* Standard Edition - allows unlimited users; $990/year.
* Enterprise Edition - allows unlimited users and unlimited teams; $2,990/year.

All the editions include unlimited projects, builds, jobs, clouds.

**To help you get started we offer 50% discount off the 1st year!**

[Download](/on-premise/#download), [install](/docs/server/) and let us know how it goes! We can't wait to hear your feedback!

Enjoy!

Best regards,<br>
AppVeyor team
