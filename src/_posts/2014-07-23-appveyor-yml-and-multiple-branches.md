title: appveyor.yml and multiple branches
---

<h2>The problem</h2>
If you use <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git flow</a> you may want to have a different build configuration (e.g. deploying to a different environment) in a feature branch. Changing <code>appveyor.yml</code> in a feature branch becomes an issue when you merge it into master overriding <code>appveyor.yml</code> and breaking master builds.
<h2>The solution</h2>
To solve this problem AppVeyor allows having multiple per-branch configurations in a single <code>appveyor.yml</code>.

Multiple configurations are defined as a <strong>list</strong> with <code>branches</code> section in every item that:

{% highlight yaml %}
# configuration for "master" branch
# build in Release mode and deploy to Azure
-
  branches:
    only:
      - master

  configuration: Release
  deploy:
    provider: AzureCS
    ...

# configuration for all branches starting from "dev-"
# build in Debug mode and deploy locally for testing
-
  branches:
    only:
      - /dev-.*/

  configuration: Debug
  deploy:
    provider: Local
    ...

# "fall back" configuration for all other branches
# no "branches" section defined
# do not deploy at all
-
  configuration: Debug
{% endhighlight %}

Unlike white- and blacklisting <code>branches</code> section here works like a selector, not a filter. Configuration selection algorithm is the following:
<ul>
    <li>Check configurations with <code>branches/only</code> section defined. If branch is found in configuration's <code>only</code> section use this configuration.</li>
    <li>Check configurations with <code>branches/except</code> section defined. If branch is NOT found in configuration's <code>except</code>section use this configuration.</li>
    <li>Check configurations WITHOUT <code>branches</code> section. If such configuration found use it.</li>
    <li>If all previous steps fail build is not run.</li>
</ul>
Enjoy!
