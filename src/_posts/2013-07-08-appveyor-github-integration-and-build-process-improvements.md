title: AppVeyor GitHub integration and build process improvements
---

Hello,

First of all, I'd like to thank all those people participating in AppVeyor beta and providing valuable feedback! You help moving the project further!

Today we released a new AppVeyor update which includes:
<ul>
    <li>Login with GitHub</li>
    <li>Selecting projects scope when authorizing with GitHub</li>
    <li>MSBuild log saving and displaying</li>
    <li>Project integration flow stability improvements</li>
</ul>
All these changes are immediately available!
<h2>Login with GitHub</h2>
It is now possible to sign up and login using GitHub account:

AppVeyor uses OAuth authentication, so your GitHub account credentials are not stored in AppVeyor database.
<h2>Selecting projects scope when authorizing with GitHub</h2>
When adding a new project from GitHub you allow AppVeyor to access your GitHub repositories. It is now possible to select authorization scope: only public projects or public and private projects. This feature is a must for developers who are members of some organizations and not allowed to give outside access to their private repositories.

<h2>MSBuild log saving and displaying</h2>
Detailed MSBuild log is now saved for every build and can be downloaded from project version screen:

<h2>Project integration flow stability improvements</h2>
We performed a very serious back-end stabilization work and re-factored communication layer between AppVeyor application and build servers. Now communication pipeline is entirely built on Azure Service Bus to be reliable for critical business applications. No more hanging builds!
