title: AppVeyor GitHub integration and build process improvements
---

Hello,

First of all, I'd like to thank all those people participating in AppVeyor beta and providing
valuable feedback! You help moving the project further!

Today we released a new AppVeyor update which includes:

* Login with GitHub
* Selecting projects scope when authorizing with GitHub
* MSBuild log saving and displaying
* Project integration flow stability improvements

All these changes are immediately available!

## Login with GitHub

It is now possible to sign up and login using GitHub account:

AppVeyor uses OAuth authentication, so your GitHub account credentials are not stored
in AppVeyor database.

## Selecting projects scope when authorizing with GitHub

When adding a new project from GitHub you allow AppVeyor to access your GitHub repositories.
It is now possible to select authorization scope: only public projects or public and private
projects. This feature is a must for developers who are members of some organizations and not
allowed to give outside access to their private repositories.

## MSBuild log saving and displaying

Detailed MSBuild log is now saved for every build and can be downloaded from project version screen:

## Project integration flow stability improvements

We performed a very serious back-end stabilization work and re-factored communication layer between
AppVeyor application and build servers. Now communication pipeline is entirely built on Azure Service
Bus to be reliable for critical business applications. No more hanging builds!
