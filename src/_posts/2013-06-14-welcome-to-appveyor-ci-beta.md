## Getting started with AppVeyor beta

AppVeyor is a cloud-based continuous integration and deployment platform for
.NET developers. It provides a customizable project build pipeline with Get,
Build, Test, Package and Deploy steps.
Checkout [AppVeyor overview](https://help.appveyor.com/kb/getting-started/appveyor-overview)
article for more details about the platform.

## What’s next

First of all, we will be focusing on completing and polishing existing
functionality and fixing bugs to make AppVeyor a great tool. Our next priority
is deployment to Azure Cloud Services and Windows clusters. We plan to give a
preview of this functionality by the end of July. After that we’ll start
implementing NuGet support. I’m sure I’ll get great ideas for AppVeyor from you.

I hope you will enjoy using AppVeyor that could become a tool you can’t live
without!

Have a great day and keep the app rolling!
