<h2>Getting started with AppVeyor beta</h2>
AppVeyor is a cloud-based continuous integration and deployment platform for .NET developers. It provides a customizable project build pipeline with Get, Build, Test, Package and Deploy steps. Checkout <a href="http://help.appveyor.com/kb/getting-started/appveyor-overview" target="_blank">AppVeyor overview</a> article for more details about the platform.
<h2>What’s next</h2>
First of all, we will be focusing on completing and polishing existing functionality and fixing bugs to make AppVeyor a great tool. Our next priority is deployment to Azure Cloud Services and Windows clusters. We plan to give a preview of this functionality by the end of July. After that we’ll start implementing NuGet support. I’m sure I’ll get great ideas for AppVeyor from you.

I hope you will enjoy using AppVeyor that could become a tool you can’t live without!

Have a great day and keep the app rolling!
