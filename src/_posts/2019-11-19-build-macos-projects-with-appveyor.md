title: Build macOS projects with AppVeyor
---

Today we are adding macOS to our hosted CI/CD environment. Now you can consolidate your multi-platform projects and run Windows, Linux and macOS builds with AppVeyor.

As with our Windows and Linux environments, we are committed to provide you with the most recent software and complete toolset for macOS. You can choose from two macOS images:

* `macos` - macOS 10.15 "Catalina"
* `macos-mojave` - macOS 10.14 "Mojave"

Both images have the latest XCode 11.2.1 pre-installed, all the latest versions of Node.js, Go, Java, .NET Core, Ruby, Python and compilers. You can find the full list of pre-installed software on [this page](/docs/macos-images-software/).

macOS builds are available to everyone by request - [send us an email](mailto:team@appveyor.com?subject=macOS%20builds).

Best regards,<br>
AppVeyor team
