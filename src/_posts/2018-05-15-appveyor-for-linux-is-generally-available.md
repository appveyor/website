title: AppVeyor for Linux is generally available
---

Dear friends!

Just a short two months ago we announced the private beta of AppVeyor for Linux and we’ve been amazed by the amount of positive feedback we received and how high the demand was.

Thank you for your active participation! We managed to find and fix some issues, add missing pieces and make it ready for GA.

Starting today `Ubuntu` image will be available to all accounts, free and paid alike. The current working image users will see is based on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) and a new one based on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) will be added soon. We are committed to providing you the best and the latest Linux experience on our platform.

There is the Getting started with AppVeyor for Linux guide (https://www.appveyor.com/docs/getting-started-with-appveyor-for-linux/) where you can also find a list of supported features and software pre-installed on the image.

Now AppVeyor is officially a multi platform CI service!

Enjoy your build!

Best regards,<br>
AppVeyor team
